# C++ DSA Starter ðŸš€

This repo is a **minimal C++ crash course** focused on Data Structures & Algorithms.  
It covers only the **20% of C++** that gives **80% benefit** for solving problems on LeetCode & in contests.  

## Structure
- `template.cpp` â†’ Base template with fast I/O (use this as your starting point).
- `01_basics/` â†’ Core syntax lessons (I/O, auto, references, memory, OOP).
- `02_stl/` â†’ STL essentials (vector, string).
- `practice_problems/` â†’ Concept-based small problems for practice.
- `leetcode_homework/` â†’ LeetCode problem skeletons (copy-paste ready).

## How to use
1. Open this repo in **VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
    ```

2. Compile any file using:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o run
   ./run
   ```
3. Solve practice problems â†’ then attempt the linked LeetCode homework.

## Learning plan

* Week 1: Basics (Lessons 1â€“5)
* Week 2: STL containers (Lessons 6â€“10)
* Week 3: Helpers (stack, queue, priority\_queue, lambdas)
* Week 4: Problem-solving patterns (two pointers, binary search, trees, graphs)

End goal â†’ 30â€“50 solved LeetCode problems + clean C++ DSA foundation ðŸŽ¯
